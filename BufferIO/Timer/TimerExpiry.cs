    /// This class is useful when implementing time outs in other methods. It can provide the remaining time, in units
    /// of milliseconds, that can be used with many Operating System calls as an expiry time.
    /// <para>
    /// One example is the <see cref="System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne()"/> method which expects a time out
    /// parameter. Either instantiate the <see cref="TimerExpiry"/> class at the beginning immediately before its use,
    /// or call the <see cref="Reset"/> method at the beginning of the time out operation. Then on return of the
    /// function, if no other operation occurred, the method <see cref="RemainingTime"/> should return 0 indicating that
    /// the timer has expired.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Another thread can be programmed to <see cref="Reset"/> the timer class during a time out operation, so that
    /// even if the result of Wait operation by the Operating system resulted in a time out, a <see cref="Reset"/>,
    /// which results in the <see cref="RemainingTime"/> being more than 0 milliseconds, indicates that another wait
    /// operation should occur.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Even if no expiry is to occur, but the Operating System function returns early, you can opt to restart the time
    /// out operation which will then take into account the current time and reduce the time out so that the operation
    /// ends as expected.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// As an example, say you need to wait for data by calling a method which waits for the first set of data within a
    /// time out. But your method must wait for at least two elements of data within the time out. This can be
    /// implemented as follows:
